# [memokana](https://louvang.github.io/memokana/)

[memokana](https://louvang.github.io/memokana/) is a memory game using Japanese katakana. The main motive is to help Japanese language learners remember katakana symbols and their meanings. In this game, you want to create a streak by clicking on 'cards' or 'tiles' you haven't already clicked on. The best way to win this game is to memorize your katakana!
